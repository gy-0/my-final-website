Hello, my name is **Yuan Gao**, a Computer Science student at Harbin Engineering University in China. I have built a strong foundation in CS and gained valuable experience through my research in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Image Processing. I believe that my academic background and practical experience will enable me to contribute significantly to the field of AI and Machine Learning.

I'm a naturally curious individual who enjoys understanding the inner workings of various systems. Contrary to the stereotype of a *"typical Chinese student"*, I value critical thinking, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit, and I strive to apply these qualities to all aspects of my life.

In my leisure time, I relish reading, traveling, and engaging in sports. I believe in maintaining a well-rounded perspective and continually seek new experiences and learning opportunities.

I am thrilled to share my journey and experiences with you, and I hope to inspire you to pursue your passions and strive for your goals.
