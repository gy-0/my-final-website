Hello, my name is **Yuan Gao**, a Computer Science student at Harbin Engineering University in China. I have a solid foundation in CS and have gained valuable experience through my research in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Image Processing. I believe that my academic background and hands-on experience will enable me to make meaningful contributions to the field of AI and Machine Learning.

I’m the kind of person who is always curious about how different things work. Unlike *"typical Chinese students"*, I value critical thinking, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit, and I strive to apply these qualities to all aspects of my life.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, and playing sports. I believe that it is important to maintain a well-rounded perspective, and I am always seeking new experiences and learning opportunities.

I am excited to share my journey and experiences with you, and I hope to inspire you to pursue your passions and reach for their goals.
